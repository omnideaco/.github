# The Codex

**A multi-scale constitutional repository for Earth**

---

## What This Is

The Codex is a living constitutional architecture designed to work across different scales of human organization—from planetary civilization to local communities.

Currently contains:

### The Covenant
A civilization-scale constitution establishing dignity, commons stewardship, and participatory democracy as foundations for planetary governance.

- **10 Parts**: Preamble through Conversion
- **Core Innovations**: 
  - Universal dignity-based sovereignty
  - Anti-property constitutionalism
  - Post-capitalist economics
  - Non-hierarchical federation
  - Comprehensive transition framework
- **Status**: Complete

### Documentation
- **Model Legislation**: Template laws for implementing Covenant principles
- **Technical Appendices**: Detailed specifications and guidance

## Why It Exists

Most constitutional systems were designed for nation-states in the 18th-20th centuries. They assume:
- Borders matter more than ecosystems
- Property rights are foundational
- Growth is endless
- Humans are separate from nature
- Individuals stand alone

**The Codex assumes none of this.**

It's written for a world where:
- Climate doesn't respect borders
- Commons need protection from enclosure
- Dignity precedes property
- Humans are part of living systems
- Worth lives in relationship

## How to Use This

### Read
Start with the [Preamble](../../Covenant/Part%2000%20–%20Preamble.md). It establishes scope and principles. Then explore the 10 Parts in order, or jump to what interests you.

### Study
The [Technical Appendices](../../Documentation/) provide implementation details. Model Legislation shows how Covenant principles translate into enforceable law.

### Adapt
The Covenant is designed to be enacted voluntarily—by communities, regions, or individuals. You don't need permission. You need commitment.

### Contribute
This is living law. It grows through use, testing, and revision. Issues, discussions, and proposed amendments are welcome.

## Principles

### Living Law
The Codex isn't fixed scripture. It's designed to evolve through use, testing, and revision—while maintaining core commitments to dignity and commons.

### Subsidiarity
Decisions should be made at the most local scale capable of handling them. The Covenant establishes planetary principles.

### Accessibility
Constitutional wisdom shouldn't require a law degree. This is written to be read, understood, and used by anyone committed to building dignified, sustainable systems.
